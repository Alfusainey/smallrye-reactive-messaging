== Customizing the underlying AMQP client

You can customize the underlying AMQP Client configuration by _producing_ an instance of `io.vertx.amqp.AmqpClientOptions`:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$customization/ClientProducers.java[tag=named]
----
This instance is retrieved and used to configure the client used by the connector.
You need to indicate the name of the client using the `client-options-name` attribute:

[source]
----
mp.messaging.incoming.prices.client-options-name=my-named-options
----
